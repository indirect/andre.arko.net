I'm really excited to announce that I've joined [Tilde][1]. Today is my first day, and I'm really excited to be working with [Yehuda][2], [Tom][3], [Carl][4], [Leah][6], [Patrick][5] and the rest of the Tilde team.

I've been working with Yehuda, Carl, and Leah since I was at Engine Yard. While I was at [Plex][11], we continued to work together on open source projects like [Bundler][9] and [Rails][10]. More recently, I've been following the development of [Handlebars][7] and [Ember][8] with great interest.

I'm looking forward to working with the latest in client-side web development using Ember, as well as helping with [the next generation of Rails development for new users][12]. Tilde is a very young company, but it's already a very exciting place to work, and I'm expecting great things in the future.
