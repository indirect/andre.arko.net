Tell me if you've heard this one before: a flying squirrel walks into a terminal, and shows you how to create a gem in 55 seconds.

I've been meaning to post about this for 18 months now, but my [Cloud City](https://cloudcity.io) coworker [Brendan Miller](https://twitter.com/brendanpgh) offered to turn a Bundler tutorial into a video containing me as an an animated flying squirrel. How could I refuse?

Just in case you needed a video explaning how to use Bundler to create a new gem, here you go!
