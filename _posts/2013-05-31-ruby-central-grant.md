title: Ruby Central Grant

It's been a long time since I first started working on [Bundler](http://gembundler.com), alongside Carl and Yehuda. Since then, the Bundler team has pushed three big feature releases, and I've taken over as project lead. One of my major goals as lead has been to cooperate with both the Rubygems and rubygems.org teams to make Bundler and Rubygems more useful to the Ruby community at large.

As part of those efforts, I've worked on Bundler and other Ruby open source during my free time (and some paid time) for the last few years. More recently, I've been [recruiting volunteers](/2013/05/12/deathmatch-bundler-vs-rubygemsorg) to help with Bundler and upcoming improvements to the Bundler API and overall Rubygems ecosystem infrastructure.

I'm extremely pleased (and excited) to announce that Ruby Central has funded a grant that will allow me to work on both Bundler and Rubygems for the next several months. To fully express my feelings when I announced the grant at my RubyKaigi talk about security, I (naturally) resorted to emoji.

Planned improvements include a new index format that will speed up installing gems, improvements to the gem distribution infrastructure, and other things still in the planning stages. The grant also means I'll have some more time to pair with and help out volunteers. If you have some free time that you’d like to contribute, let me know! We like supporting new contributors to open source, and we would love to have your help.
 
I'll be posting updates here and on the [Rubygems blog](http://blog.rubygems.org) as interesting bits are completed. It should be pretty great, and I'm definitely looking forward to it.
