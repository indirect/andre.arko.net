title: Open Source at Mavenlink
---
I've started a new job, and I'm pretty excited about it. [Mavenlink](http://www.mavenlink.com) has hired me to be their new open source lead. Part of my new job is going to be working with their engineers to give open source a bigger presence at Mavenlink, and that is pretty cool. Another part will include improving Mavenlink's API and making it easier for developers to use. The part I am most excited about, though, is that I'm going to be working directly on improving the Ruby and Rails open source ecosystem. That will include spending more time improving Bundler, jquery-rails, and my other OSS projects, as well as extracting and open sourcing libraries and components that Mavenlink has built.

I have [big plans](http://andre.arko.net/2012/07/23/towards-a-bundler-plugin-system/) for the future of Bundler. I'm excited to have Mavenlink supporting those efforts, and proud to be working with a team that values contributing back to the Ruby community.
