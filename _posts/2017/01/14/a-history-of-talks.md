I've added a new section to this blog, listing all of the talks I have given at meetups, events, and conferences.

Rather than organize by event, the way that websites like Lanyrd or Speaker Deck do, I've combined every time I've given a particular talk into a single entry. Where possible, each talk has not just a description, but also links to a written version of the talk, the slides I used while giving the talk, and a video of the talk from that particular event.

Without further ado, please feel free to check out [talks by Andr√© Arko](/talks/).
