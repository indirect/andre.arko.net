I'm a little bit surprised to be saying this, but the week that just ended was my last week at [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com). I've had a great time working on [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) and EY's [Cloud](http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud), and I am sure EY will continue to do great things.

Even though I'm leaving Engine Yard, I am staying on the Bundler team. I will be working closely with Carl and Yehuda in the coming weeks to resolve issues in the beta versions and finish the 1.0 release.

That said, starting Monday, I'm going to be working at [Plex](http://plexapp.com). I've already used Plex for a year or two myself, and I really like it. It's very exciting to be working on a project I personally like with a small team of very cool people. I'm looking forward to it a lot.
