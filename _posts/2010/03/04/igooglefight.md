I was horrified and dismayed to learn, the other week, that [GoogleFight](http://googlefight.com) uses flash to present the results of fights. This meant I couldn't use it on my iPhone, which was horrible. So I built a [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/) app, backed by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). It handles all of my Google-fighting needs in style, and without any Flash whatsoever.

So, without any further ado, I present:
