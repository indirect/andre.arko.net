title: Security is hard
---

This week, I gave a talk at [Ruby on Ales](http://ruby.onales.com/) about CVEs, responsible disclosure, and security process and best practices. The conference was awesome, and it was a blast to be able to give a talk there. I hope that rubyists will be able to embrace and extend the best practices discovered by years of community experimentation!

I'll update this post with a link to the video once it's posted. In the meantime, you can check out the slides here, [over on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/indirect/security-is-hard-but-we-cant-go-shopping), or [as a PDF file]({% postfile security-is-hard.pdf %}).
