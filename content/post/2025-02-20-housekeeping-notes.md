Hey, nice, my blog has a navbar now! In addition to the (previously hidden) pages for [Conference Talks](/talks) and [Personal Projects](/projects), there is a completely new page for my [Professional Resum√©](/resume), which I have updated for the first time in uh... probably 12 years. So that's good.

My personal about and splash page at [arko.net](https://arko.net) is also readable on phone-sized screens now. That only took 15 years or so.

If you're seeing this, that also means I have successfully migrated from my legacy Netlify setup to my new setup on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). Now that I'm done moving all the existing posts, I can write new posts here without having to check out my git repo and create new markdown files and commit and push them. Hooray.

Coming up next: still working on importing 18 years worth of tumblr posts into another micro.blog instance, and also planning to add linkblog-style posts to this blog so I can post smaller things even more easily.
