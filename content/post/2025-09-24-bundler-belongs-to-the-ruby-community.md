I’ve spent 15 years of my life working on Bundler. When I introduce myself, people say "oh, the Bundler guy?", and I am forced to agree.

I didn’t come up with the original idea for Bundler (that was Yehuda). I also didn’t work on the first six months worth of prototypes. That was all Carl and Yehuda together, back when "Carlhuda" was a super-prolific author of Ruby libraries, including most of the work to modularize Rails for version 3.

I joined the team at a pivotal moment, in February 2010, as the 0.9 prototype was starting to be re-written yet another time into the shape that would finally be released as 1.0. By the time Carl, Yehuda, and I released version 1.0 together in August 2010, we had fully established the structure and commands that Bundler 2.7.2 still uses today.

I gave my first conference talk about Bundler at Red Dirt Ruby in May 2010. Because they would be too busy with Rails 3 talks, Yehuda and Carl asked me to give the first RailsConf talk about Bundler, in June 2010.

As Carl and Yehuda drifted off to other projects, in 2011 and 2012 respectively, I took on a larger role, co-maintaining the project with Terence Lee, then on the Ruby platform team at Heroku. We shipped (and, embarrassingly, broke) many versions of Bundler on our way to the 1.1 release and its major speed improvements. We also gave several conference talks together, sharing what we had learned about Bundler, about gems, and about maintaining open source.

In 2013, I managed to convince the owner of `bundler.io` to sell me his domain, and rebuilt the website to host a separate copy of the documentation for every version of Bundler, ensuring even users on old versions could still access accurate documentation.

By the end of 2013, Terence had drifted away from the project as well, and I realized that everyone using Ruby was now one bus (or one lottery ticket) away from Bundler having no significant maintainers. During 2014, I made sure to settle any remaining ownership issues, including purchasing the rights to the Bundler logo, and began investigating various funding ideas. I tried specialized consulting, corporate sponsorships, and asking Ruby Central about sponsoring Bundler and RubyGems development work. Ruby Central declined, citing their desire to stay focused on conferences, but suggested that if I wanted to pursue something myself they would be happy to collaborate.

In 2015, I founded Ruby Together specifically to raise funds to pay the existing maintainers team of Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org. Over time, we were able to raise enough money to quietly but scrappily keep the entire RubyGems ecosystem maintained and functional. Ruby Together did not ever, at any point, demand any form of governance or control over the existing open source projects. Maintainers did their thing in the RubyGems and Bundler GitHub orgs, while Ruby Together staff and board members did their thing in the rubytogether GitHub org.

By 2021, when Ruby Central and Ruby Together were both interested in merging together, funds were harder to find. Ruby Together had a membership program. Ruby Central wanted a to have a membership program. The confusing split between “Ruby Central owns the AWS account, but Ruby Together pays all the devs” continued to be a problem.

We prepared [a merger agreement](merger-agreement.pdf) (which you can read in full at the link), stating that Ruby Central’s new goal after the merger would be “paying maintainers to do the programming”. The agreement also states that Ruby Central will follow Ruby Together’s [Vision, Mission, and Values](https://github.com/rubycentral/board/blob/38904a634d5993e244911087efdaa54811d2d516/VISION_MISSON_VALUES.md), a document that is hosted in the rubycentral GitHub organization today. That document includes a very specific list of goals, including:

- Project users and maintainers are empowered to decide what’s best for their projects
- Ruby open source developers are paid for their work
- Give control to the community
 - Be accountable and transparent to the community
- Establish a collaborative, positive space for projects
- Have a clear and transparent funding process

You can read much more in both the merger agreement and in the Mission, Vision, and Values document, but the fundamental goal for both the non-profit and the open source projects is clear: this is all for the Ruby community. Without the community, there is no point to this work, and there is no way it could ever have been done in the first place. Without the 354 individuals who contributed to Bundler and to RubyGems, I could never have become "the Bundler guy" in the first place.

In the last few weeks, Ruby Central has [suddenly asserted](https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/) that they alone own Bundler. That simply isn’t true. In order to defend the reputation of the team of maintainers who have given so much time and energy to the project, I have registered my existing trademark on the Bundler project.

Trademarks do not affect copyright, which stays with the original contributors unchanged. Trademarks do not affect license terms, which stay MIT and unchanged. Trademarks only impact one thing: who is allowed say that what they make is named "Bundler". Ruby Central is welcome to the code, just like everyone else. They are not welcome to the project name that the Bundler maintainers have painstakingly created over the last 15 years.

While the trademark has been registered under my name as an individual, I will not keep it for myself, because the idea of Bundler belongs to the Ruby community. Once there is a Ruby organization that is accountable to the maintainers, and accountable to the community, with openly and democratically elected board members, I commit to transfer my trademark to that organization.

I will not license the trademark, and will instead transfer ownership entirely. Bundler should belong to the community, and I want to make sure that is true for as long as Bundler exists.
