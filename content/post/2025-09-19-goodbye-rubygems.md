As chronicled by my teammate Ellen, [the RubyGems team is no more](https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf). I wish the best of luck to everyone taking on the herculean task of keeping package management functional and working for the entire Ruby community.

In the meantime, I'm looking forward to spending my new free time focusing on projects that I'm truly excited about, like [`rv`](https://rv.dev). We'd love to have your help as we work to build next-generation tools for Ruby.
