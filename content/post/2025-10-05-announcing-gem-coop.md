The team behind the last ten years of rubygems.org, including @deivid-rodriguez, @duckinator, @martinemde, @segiddins, @simi, and myself, is very pleased to announce a new gem server for the Ruby community: [gem.coop](https://gem.coop).

The new serverâ€™s governance policies are being prepared in coordination with Mike McQuaid of Homebrew, and will be released later this week.

The current versions of RubyGems and Bundler work with this new server already, and any Ruby developer is welcome to switch to using this new server immediately.

We have exciting plans to add new features and functionality in the coming days. [Join us!](https://gem.coop)
