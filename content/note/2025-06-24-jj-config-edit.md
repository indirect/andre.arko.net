Today I stumbled across a [jj cheat sheet](https://justinpombrio.net/src/jj-cheat-sheet.pdf) and it contained an absolute gem of a command that I had somehow completely avoided knowing about this entire time: `jj config edit --user`. You can just run a jj command to open the config file in your editor! You don't have to remember whether you put it in `~/.jjconfig.toml`, or `~/.config/jj/config.toml`, or whatever, you can just edit it! Super great.
