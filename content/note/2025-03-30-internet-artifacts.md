I stumbled across [neal.fun](https://neal.fun)'s [Internet Artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/) site today and immediately spent an hour interacting with the artifacts. The biggest standouts for me weren’t the websites I remembered from back then, but instead the ones that I don’t remember at all. Even though I was theoretically there at the time, I never really interacted with Ishkur’s guide to electronic music, Club Penguin, or The Impossible Quiz. Making historical websites partly alive again is a great framing.
