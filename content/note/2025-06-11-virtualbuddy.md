Apple released developer beta versions of all their OSes this week, and in the past Iâ€™ve sometimes upgraded my laptop to the developer betas while reserving my desktop/server to run the final releases. The problem with that plan is if thereâ€™s a bad bug in the beta, your laptop doesnâ€™t work anymore. ðŸ¥²

I ran across a very cool solution for this problem in a post on bluesky (sorry I canâ€™t find it anymore, whoever posted the link!). [VirtualBuddy](https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy) is a GUI app that wraps the macOS built-in Virtualization.framework to make it super easy to run macOS VMs on top of macOS. If you have a developer account, itâ€™s literally only three clicks to get a macOS beta VM up and running, which is extremely cool.
