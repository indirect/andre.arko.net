Today I was trying to figure out how to parse a string into an array in zsh, and eventually found [the zsh cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/ClementNerma/1dd94cb0f1884b9c20d1ba0037bdcde2). This should definitely be posted somewhere much easier to find, or maybe should just be the beginning of the zsh man page.
