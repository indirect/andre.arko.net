I'm a longtime user of [`jq`](https://jqlang.org), but its language is... not intuitive to me. I spent a lot of time searching for prewritten jq programs I can use, or reading the docs trying to figure out the exact thing that I want to do. Mostly, I think to myself "why do I have to learn a new language to manipulate JSON" every time I use it, even if my use is successful and does the thing I want.

Good news, you don't have to learn a new language to filter JSON anymore, thanks to [`fx`](https://fx.wtf). With a docs site at the excellent domain [fx.wtf](https://fx.wtf), and the ability to filter interactively or by providing Javascript as arguments, fx is the program I have always wished that jq was.
