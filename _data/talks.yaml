- title: From No OSS Experinece to the Core Team in 15 Minutes Per Day
  description: Using and contributing to open source has been a cornerstone of the
    Ruby community for many years. Despite this strong tradition, it’s hard to find
    anything collecting the likely advantages and costs of working on open source.
    This talk will introduce open source work, the benefits and costs of doing that
    work, and then provide a straightforward list of activities that can be done by
    anyone, no matter their level of experience with programming. Pick a project,
    schedule at least 15 minutes per day, join the core team. It’s your destiny!
