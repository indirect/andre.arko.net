- title: From No OSS Experinece to the Core Team in 15 Minutes Per Day
  description: Using and contributing to open source has been a cornerstone of the
    Ruby community for many years. Despite this strong tradition, it’s hard to find
    anything collecting the likely advantages and costs of working on open source.
    This talk will introduce open source work, the benefits and costs of doing that
    work, and then provide a straightforward list of activities that can be done by
    anyone, no matter their level of experience with programming. Pick a project,
    schedule at least 15 minutes per day, join the core team. It’s your destiny!

  post_url: "/2016/09/26/a-year-of-ruby-together/"
  description: 'Ruby Together is a simple concept: Ruby developers and companies all
    pay a small amount of money. That money ensures that Bundler, RubyGems, and other
    critical software continues to work, by paying developers to work on it. While
    the concept is simple, creating Ruby Together was very complicated in practice.
    In this talk I’ll explain why I was motivated to start Ruby Together, how it became
    possible, and what we have done for Ruby in our first year.'

  description: 'When you look at your response times, satisfied that they are "fast
    enough", you''re forgetting an important thing: your users are on the other side
    of a network connection, and their browser has to process and render the data
    that you sent so quickly. This talk examines some often overlooked parts of web
    applications that can destroy your user experience even when your response times
    seem fantastic. We''ll talk about networks, routing, client and server-side VMs,
    and how to measure and mitigate their issues.'

  description: This talk is about the twin open source project goals of, on the one
    hand, increasing participation and contribution to an open source project, and
    on the other hand including everyone while eliminating discrimination and harassment
    (whether deliberate or accidental). I'll talk about different approaches to reducing
    discrimination, including better documentation, better development tooling, explicit
    onboarding process, and codes of conduct. I'll also cover concrete steps that
    anyone can take to help increase inclusion and participation in the teams, communities,
    and open source projects that they are involved in.

  description: We all use Bundler at some point, and most of us use it every day.
    But what does it do, exactly? Why do we have to use bundle exec? What's the point
    of checking in the Gemfile.lock? Why can't we just `gem install` the gems we need?
    Join me for a walk through the reasons that Bundler exists, and a guide to what
    actually happens when you use it. Finally, we'll cover some Bundler "pro tips"
    that can improve your workflow when developing on multiple applications at once.

- title: Lies, Damn Lies, and Metrics
  description: 'Metrics are great, and measuring things can provide tremendously useful
    insights. But there''s a problem: metrics lie to you. Metrics just report the
    numbers that were measured. Analyzing those numbers is up to us, and that analysis
    can go wrong in so, so many ways. Learn how to arm yourself against human intuition,
    interpreter pauses, routing, instrumentation lag, and other issues. Don''t get
    so caught up in instrumenting that you lose sight of why metrics exist! Make sure
    your metrics are telling you actionable information, instead of just accurate
    numbers.'

- title: Development Was The Easy Part
  description: 'We want to produce reliable, functioning software… but we often don’t.
    The cliched cry of “but it works on my machine” demonstrates the myopia that most
    web developers (including me) suffer from: we spend almost all of our time working
    with a development environment. This leads us to think of production as “like
    development, with people using it”. Then, when things go wrong, we think “oh,
    I see now, production is like development except this one thing that went wrong”.
    This is exactly the opposite of the mindset we need. Production is fundamentally
    different from development, and it’s important to keep that in mind. This talk
    discusses some of those fundamental differences, including load balancing, metrics,
    data store reliability, and network partitions. Don’t get stuck rebuilding your
    servers at 3AM because you went with the option that was easiest during development!'

- title: The Iceberg of Webdev
  description: 'If you do web developement, you''ve probably noticed that "distributed
    systems" and "service oriented architecture" are really hot topics right now.
    I have a surprise for you, though: you already work on a distributed system with
    a service oriented architecture, because every webapp is one. That means you''ve
    already decided how your distributed system is going to work, and chances are
    good you didn''t even know you were making those decisions. This talk will uncover
    the hidden decisions that shape web applications, including how the org chart
    limits service architecture, and how consistency and availability by default seems
    great until it''s 3am and the data store needs to be rebuilt by hand to bring
    the site back up. Once the decisions aren''t hidden anymore, I''ll explain some
    other options, and why you might want to pick them to save yourself pain in the
    future.'

    ways you can use Bundler and other tools together to boost your development productivity.
    I’ll walk through how to use the lesser-known but very handy commands like bundle
    gem, bundle open, and a few others. I’ll show you how to use Bundler to make sure
    you always run your app on the right version of Ruby, how to search through every
    gem in your Gemfile with a single command, and how to check for newer versions
    of the gems you use.

  description: If you've ever done anything in ruby, you've probably used rubygems
    and to search or install your favorite gem. On October 17, 2012, rubygems.org
    went down. A Dependency API was built to be used by Bundler 1.1+ to speed up bundle
    install. Unfortunately, it was a bit too popular and the service caused too much
    load on the current infrasture. In order to get rubygems.org back up the API had
    to be disabled.

  post_url: "/2013/08/22/security-is-hard-but-we-cant-go-shopping/"
  description: The last year has been brutal for Ruby and security. Ruby has gotten
    quite popular, which is really exciting! But it also means that we are now square
    in the crosshairs of security researchers, whether whitehat, blackhat, or some
    other hat. Before 2013, only the Ruby and Rails core teams had meaningful experience
    with security issues. This year everyone got meaningful experience. Vulnerabilities
    are everywhere, and handling security issues responsibly is critical if we want
    Ruby (and Rubyists) to stay safe and in high demand. I’ll discuss responsible
    disclosure, as well as repsonsible ownership of your own code. How do you know
    if a bug is a security issue, and how do you report it without tipping off someone
    malicious? As a Rubyist, you probably have at least one library of your own. How
    do you handle security issues, and fix them without compromising apps running
    on the old code? Don’t let your site get hacked, or worse yet, let your project
    allow someone else’s site to get hacked! Learn from the hard-won wisdom of the
    security community so that we won’t repeat the mistakes of others.

    mode makes things easy on developers, obsoleting that out of date list of gems
    in your app’s readme. Deploying, however, isn’t as obvious. What if you’re using
    Sinatra or something else that isn’t Rails? How do you deploy a bundled app using
    Capistrano, or Vlad, or your own script? What are the best practices for deploying
    to an app running in Mongrel, Unicorn, or Passenger? What if your server doesn’t
    have an internet connection to talk to rubygems.org? These questions and others
    will be answered by a member of the Bundler core team.

- title: Why Bundler?
  description: There comes a point in every programming language's life, where the
    question of dependency management arises. That is, "if A requires B and B requires
    C, and C requires D, what happens when I install A." Believe it or not, that's
    actually an easy question, the hard question is "What happens when I install A,
    but I have two apps on a machine that rely on different versions of C and D. Ruh-oh
    Fortunately, Andre will be joining us at SunnyConf to talk about painless dependency
    management with Bundler. Bundler, which has been released alongside Rails 3, has
    been designed to fix all of your dependency problems. It makes using dependencies
    easy and reliable at the same time. Bundler can handle your Rails gem plugins,
    your application's dependancies, and even your dependencies' dependencies, all
    automatically. In this talk, Andre will walk us through why Bundler was written,
    and why you should be using it for all of your Ruby applications. He'll talk about
    how to use it effectively in common scenarios and even cover it's usage within
    Rails 3, Rails 2, Sinatra, and your own Ruby application. He'll also share where
    Bundler is headed in the future.
